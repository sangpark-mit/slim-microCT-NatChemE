# slim-microCT-NatChemE
This Matlab code was developed for the microCT analysis featured in the paper "Self-aggregating Long-acting Injectable Microcrystals" published in Nature Chemical Engineering (2025).

## Description
- The code loads image files in .tif format for processing.
- It performs cropping, histogram analysis, thresholding, and calculates the packing efficiency.

## Requirements
- MATLAB
- Image Processing Toolbox

## Output
- Cropped and thresholded images are displayed.
- Histograms of pixel intensities are generated.
- Packing efficiency is calculated and displayed as mean and standard deviation.
